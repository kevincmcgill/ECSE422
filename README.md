## ECSE422 - Project: Communication Network Designer

This program reads an input file containing information about the number of cities, the reliabilities, and the cost of each inter-city connections.

The program then saves all solutions to the following requirements in **3 different output files** for easy display:

<p style= "margin-left: 30px">
A)  Meet a given reliability goal <br />
B) Meet a given reliability goal subject to a given cost constraint <br />
C) Maximize reliability subject to a given cost constraint <br />
</p>

#### User input through console prompt

The program will ask the following parameters about your desired parameters. Here are some example values you can input. _Please respect the input value type._

> 1. Please enter reliability goal (from 0 to 1): **0.95**
> 2. Please enter cost constraint (from 1 to 100): **90**
> 3. Would you like to run part A? (y/n) **n**
> 4. Would you like to run part B? (y/n) **y**
> 5. Would you like to run part C? (y/n) **y**

# ECSE422 - Project: Communication Network Designer

This program reads an input file containing information about the number of cities, the reliabilities, and the cost of each inter-city connections.

The program then saves all solutions to the following requirements in **3 different output files** for easy display:

A) Meet a given reliability goal <br />
B) Meet a given reliability goal subject to a given cost constraint <br />
C) Maximize reliability subject to a given cost constraint <br />

#### User input through console prompt

The program will ask the following parameters about your desired parameters. Here are some example values you can input. _Please respect the input value type._

> Please enter reliability goal (from 0 to 1): **0.95** <br />
> Please enter cost constraint (from 1 to 100): **90** <br />
> Would you like to run part A? (y/n) **n** <br />
> Would you like to run part B? (y/n) **y** <br />
> Would you like to run part C? (y/n) **y** <br />
